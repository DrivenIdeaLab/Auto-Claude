# ⚠️ This Document Has Moved

**Setup documentation has been consolidated.**

**Please see:** [`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md)

---

## Why the Change?

Auto Claude had **4 separate setup documents** with overlapping and sometimes conflicting information:
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md`
- `SETUP_FINAL.md`
- `FINAL_SETUP_SUMMARY.md`
- Setup sections scattered in `README.md`

**This caused confusion** about which document to follow for setup.

## New Setup Guide

All setup instructions are now in a single comprehensive guide:

**📖 [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**

This guide includes:
- ✅ **Prerequisites** - Python versions, Node.js, Docker, Git requirements
- ✅ **Quick Start** - Both Desktop UI and CLI-only paths
- ✅ **Full Installation** - Step-by-step for Python, OAuth, Memory Layer, UI
- ✅ **Environment Configuration** - Complete `.env` reference for all providers
- ✅ **Verification Steps** - How to test your installation
- ✅ **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- ✅ **Advanced Configuration** - Custom models, endpoints, CI/CD
